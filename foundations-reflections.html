            <strong>What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            I discovered I was very open to new techniques that I would have otherwise never had given a thought such as meditation.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            The understanding that I can accomplish this course and that applied growth mindset is a useful tool. The neuroplasticity research was very interesting.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Being honest with myself and self-aware will allow me to progress each week.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            <strong>What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</strong> 
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Having good positive values can help guide to better decision making. 
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Empathy  gives us the ability to understand and share the feelings of others. It can help you collaborate better with other team members or stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Self-awareness is important to understand your own emotions, strengths, and weakness’s. Its important in programming to identify areas where you need to improve or what you should be focusing your time on improving/ working on etc. Self-awareness can also lead to better communication. 
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            <strong>has surprised you the most about the core learning?</strong> 
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            I always knew having good core skills where important for all aspects of life and especially work and relationships, but this has really broadened my understanding for it all. By breaking it down and really analysing the whys has been a great learning experience.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            <strong>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Knowing that Time will tell if I can apply them to the best of my ability.  I know I can do it I just need to go out and give it my best.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            <strong>Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            To not just make us employable programmers but employable people. With the right core skills I believe we can all go far in our careers beyond the role of developers and this can be very prosperous in the future.
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            <strong>Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</strong>
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            Not at all I believe its import to understand these concepts or even reflect on them if you are already aware. My answer for Why would be the same as my previous answer “ With the right core skills I believe we can all go far in our careers beyond the role of developers, and this can be very prosperous in the future.” 
        </p>
        <p class="lp-text">
            I Hope I can take what I have learnt here and use it to better my chance of getting a job when I am interacting with potential employers.
