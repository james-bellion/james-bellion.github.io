    <p class="lp-text">
        This week I was stuck on the unjumble test. The objective was to complete the unjumble function, which accepts a string as an argument and reverses it, then returns the reversed string, using the built-in JavaScript methods for strings and arrays to accomplish this.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        I first tried to break it down in steps using pseudo code and figure out what I needed to do but I was not using the correct methods and was not able to find the answer right away!
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        It was frustrating to say the least, so I took a break and went and had lunch. I learnt it was imported not to get to worked up about it.

    <h2 class="lp-heading">Wroking Through the problem</h2>
    <p class="lp-text">
        One cheese toastie later I came back to the problem with fresh eyes and researched the methods I needed using google. I then planned to tackle the issue by writing some pseudo code,  step by step in the order of what I needed to do. I then ran the code with a console.log and it worked ! 
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        It felt great having solved the task in contrast to feeling frustrated earlier. It was also a relief to complete the task and move on to the next.

    <h2 class="lp-heading">Reflections on how confident you feel using each of these problem-solving techniques/processes:</h2>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Pseudocode: </strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">Depending how complex the task is I feel confident with this process as long as I know the right order in which to write my code.</p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Trying something:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">Trial and error is great and I am semi confident trying different ways of writing the code.</p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Rubber ducky method:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        I feel like I am getting lots of practice using this technique and feel confident with it. I find it help me learn a lot as well as picking out those pesky character errors.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Reading error messages:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        I still feel as if I am getting used to this method but it’s very helpful to check as it can point you towards the solution. Or gives you something to research to find the answer.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Console.logging</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        Sometimes being the only way to check your code console logging is becoming a great weapon in my problem-solving arsenal. I’m feeling more confident using I as I go through my code but there is still room for improvement!
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Googling:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        One I am most familiar with. I don’t know what I would do without it sometime! very confident in finding examples of techniques to use through google giving me a greater understanding of the problem at hand.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Asking your peers for help:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        Great benefit of the forums and home groups is having this option. I have asked for help on the forums, and I have had great feedback so far.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Asking coaches for help:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        Not shy to send my facilitators a message when I’m stuck. I think its important to ask them for help when I get really stuck on a certain task and I’m grateful for the help they provide that keeps me from getting stuck in the mud.
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        <strong>Improving your process with reflection:</strong>
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        I personally use this a lot to try and improve my process. Just taking a couple of minutes to go over what I have just learnt helps me retain the knowledge. 
    </p>
</section>
<section class="section-E">
    <h2 class="lp-heading">Reflect on a time you were reluctant to ask for help. Consider what made you reluctant to do so.</h2>
    <p class="lp-text">
        During the first intro into JavaScript, I failed a few more of the tests then I would have liked, and I felt reluctant to ask for help. Instead, I did lots of extra exercises to help build my knowledge and coding muscle memory so I could come back and tackle the challenge again. 
    </p>
    <p class="lp-text">
        If I was to still have issues going forward from there, I would have made the decision to reach out, but luckily the extra resources I worked through boosted my understanding.
