          Explain a situation where you have made an ethical decision. Discuss
          how you weighed up the values involved in that decision, the decision
          you made, and how you reflect on the decision now.
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          A. I am a father of Two, my wonderful children are Axel and Mila. I
          was 25 years old when my amazing partner became pregnant with our
          first son Axel. It was an unplanned pregnancy and at the time being 25
          I still considered myself a young parent to be, even Tho thinking
          about It many people have children all over the world at a much
          younger age but for personal context I was “the first one” to have
          children out of friends my own age.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I am happy we agreed to go ahead with the pregnancy opposed to other
          options and having children has given me a great sense of fulfillment
          and happiness. I believe it has also changed me to become a better
          person.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Reflecting on the decision now, sometimes I miss my sleep, but I have
          no regrets as I love our little family. Having children in your
          twenties does make life challenging especially if you’re studying for
          a new career, saving to buy a house, and just generally getting by in
          this day and age.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I think it’s been a great decision for me to have children at a
          younger age as feel I have more energy now than I would in 10 years’
          time and feel very connected to my kids. It also gives them a chance
          to grow up with their grandparents.

          Describe how your culture and the people around you have influenced
          your values and identity.
        </h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Hi, I’m James (He/him) 29 from the UK. Having grown up in England I
          would say this has had a great impact on my values and identity as a
          proud Englishman, fond of its rich history and traditions, Sports, and
          culture. My love for traveling and living in different countries has
          also shaped my values and identity allowing me to learn more amazing
          things about the people and the world we live in.
        </p>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Like nearly all people my parents have had a great influence on my
          values and identity. My Dad’s a great inspiration to me and has shown
          me people are not limited in what they can achieve in life. He grew up
          in Liverpool at a time when opportunities were slim for most, but he
          didn’t follow the crowd and went into the IT industry to make a good
          career. He and my mum are/ have been great parents and sacrificed a
          lot and their good moral values have defiantly made me the person I am
          today as well as helped me be a better parent to my children and I am
          thankfully for that.

             Taking an analytical approach to problems and trying to use my

             Having resilience should help when I need to Dig in deep and
            keeping on going where sometimes I may not understand concepts right
            off the bat but knowing answers will come to me eventually if I keep
            trying.

             Last year I studied “IT essentials level 4” part time whilst
            working and throughout I had little contact with teachers during the
            course as it was done remotely. That experiance gave boosted my
            strengths in doing my own research and finding solutions to problems
            on my own.

             Knowing why I am learning in the first place is an overlooked
            strength that I believe I have. It helps me stay focused and stay on
            track towards achieving goals. Looking ahead at the bigger picture
            motivates me to succeed in my learning journey.

        <ul class="blog-ul">
          <li class="blog-text">	I struggled with learning at school, having extra time in my exams due to dyslexia. I really must have a good look over things sometimes, taking a little longer to get things done as I try to be careful. (e.g., code not working as a word was missing a letter or tag lol). It’s not too bad but I do notice it trips me up sometimes.</li>
          <li class="blog-text">	On certain days I often have doubts about myself/ experience of imposter syndrome that can bring up some anxiety. I have not worked in an office environment before was never a technical person when at school. With that being said I believe I have the potential to achieve a high level of success with my confidence, knowledge and experience growing each day.</li>

        <h3>Share an example of when you were trying to work productively with others, but there was resistance or tension. Discuss strategies you tried at the time, how effective they were, and your reflections on what other strategies you would try now and why.</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">For context I used to work as a chef and was proud of my achievements that led me to a leadership role where I never pictured myself in at the time as a lowly dishwasher and I learnt a lot about life in this role and enjoyed the job!</p>
        <p class="blog-text">Kitchen environments can be very hostile places and a high-pressure environment, especially on busy days.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">One day I was in charge the kitchen, calling out the orders, coordinating with other chefs, restaurant manager, sending out the food, always communicating ect as chefs do.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">One of the chefs was having an off day and was making mistakes with food orders. I have seen many chefs get angry in these situations and would shout at the poor guy and it just makes the situation ugly and worse. I could feel the pressure as some tickets where mounting up and we were falling behind but I remembered the chilled out, older, very experienced guy Connor who used to lead our team at one time and how he just slowed things down and took a look at what was going wrong and methodically fixed the problem by talking to the team and calmly giving out instructions to get us back on track and that’s exactly what I did and feel this approach got me out of this tricky situation in no time and we were back on track.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">I just kept communicating with the chef who was making the mistakes as he was feeling frustrated and angry, but I kept encouraging him whilst giving him advice on what to do and when to do it. It can be a lot of multi-tasking but kept the team together and we all put in a good effort.</p>
        <p class="blog-text">These situations happen, they have happened to me, so I knew how it’s stressful. It’s positive to help others grow. I may not have realized it at that moment in time, but it helped me grow as a leader.</p>
