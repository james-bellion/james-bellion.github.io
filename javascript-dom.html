        <h1 class="lp-heading">Control flow and loops</h1>
        <p class="lp-text">control flow can be like making a pizza! It involves following a specific order of steps, such as preparing dough, adding sauce, cheese, and toppings, and baking at the right temperature and time. Loops in pizza making involve repeating certain steps or actions for multiple pizzas, layers, or mini pizzas. Just like in programming, control flow and loops in pizza making ensure a successful pizza creation process.</p>

        <h1 class="lp-heading">what is the DOM?</h1>
    <p class="lp-text">The Document Object Model (DOM) is like a way to interact with a web page using code. It's like a tree of objects that represents the different parts of a web page, like headings, images, paragraphs, and buttons.</p>
    <p class="lp-text">Imagine you're looking at a web page and you want to change something on it, like the text of a heading or the colour of a button. You can use the DOM to do that! You can use a programming language like JavaScript to tell the DOM what you want to change and how you want to change it. For example, you can tell the DOM to update the text of a heading to say something else, or to change the colour of a button when it's clicked.</p>
    <p class="lp-text">You can also use the DOM to add new things to a web page or remove things from it. For example, you can tell the DOM to add a new item to a list, or to remove a paragraph from a section of a web page.</p>
    <p class="lp-text">In summary, the DOM is a way to interact with a web page using code, allowing you to change, add, or remove elements on the page using programming languages like JavaScript.</p>

        <h1 class="lp-heading">Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h1>
        <p class="lp-text">Arrays are like lists of items stored in a specific order, where you access items using numerical indexes. Objects are like collections of properties with names or keys, where you access values using those names. Arrays are useful for storing and accessing data in a specific order<strong> Like a list or a menu</strong>, while objects are handy for associating data with meaningful names or keys for easy retrieval.<strong> Like a Toolbox!</strong></p>

    <section class="section-E">
        <h1 class="lp-heading">Explain what functions are and why they are helpful?</h1>
        <p class="lp-text">Functions in JavaScript are like superpowers that help you do things faster and easier.</p>
        <p class="lp-text">Imagine you have a special tool that can do a specific job, like a "paintbrush" that can paint different colours. Instead of painting each colour one by one, you can just use the paintbrush with different colours and it will do the job for you! That's what a function does in JavaScript. It's like a tool that you can create and give a name, and then you can use it over and over again to do a specific job without having to repeat the same steps. Functions can also take inputs, like the things you want to paint, and they can give you outputs, like the final result. Just like a superpower that helps you save time and effort, functions in JavaScript make your code more efficient and organized!</p>
